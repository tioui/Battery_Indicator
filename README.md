Battery_Indicator
=================

This is a minimalist tray battery indicator for Linux created in Eiffel. It 
is functionnal on a MacBookPro 7.1 using Linux Ubuntu 14.04. It should be 
easy to adapt to your need. See the {BATTERY_PROTOCOL} class.

I use it with an awesome desktop to have a graphical battery widget.
